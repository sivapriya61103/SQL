DESCRIPTION:

The question you were given is asking you to write an SQL query to retrieve data from a table that meets certain conditions. 
In this case, the condition is that the "country" column in the "customers" table must be equal to "USA" and the "age" column must be greater than 25.
The query SELECT * FROM customers WHERE country = 'USA' AND age > 25 retrieves all rows from the "customers" table where the "country" column is equal to "USA" and the "age" column is greater than 25.
The query uses the WHERE clause to specify the conditions that must be met, and the AND operator to combine the conditions. 
The asterisk (*) in the SELECT statement means that all columns in the "customers" table will be returned.

SQL QUERY:


--CREATING A TABLE CALLED CUSTOMERS

create table customers(customer_id int,customer_name varchar(10),country varchar(10),age int);

--INSRETING THE VALUES INTO THE CUSTOMER TABLE

insert into customers values(1,'John Smith','USA',30);
insert into customers values(2,'Jane Doe','Canada',42);
insert into customers values(3,'Alex Kim','USA',20);
insert into customers values(4,'Emily Chen','China',28);
insert into customers values(5,'Tom Johnson','USA',37);
insert into customers values(6,'Lisa Lee','Korea',24);

--QUERY FOR RETRIVING DATA FROM THE TABLE CUSTOMERS

select * from customers where country = 'USA'and age > 25;

OUTPUT:

customer_id	customer_name	country	age
1	        John Smith	USA	30
5	        Tom Johnson	USA	37
